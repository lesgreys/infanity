<roadmap_explanation>
In creating this roadmap for Infanity, I focused on addressing the key aspects mentioned in the product description: bringing together artists, fans, creators, and labels while incorporating streaming, ad spend, and web3 technology. The approach taken was to build a solid foundation for the platform in the first two months, then rapidly expand features and user acquisition in the following months.

Key assumptions made:
1. The initial focus is on building a robust platform and attracting independent artists and fans.
2. Web3 integration is a crucial differentiator but is implemented later to ensure core functionality is solid.
3. Partnerships with major labels are a longer-term goal, with initial focus on independent artists and labels.

Challenges considered:
1. Balancing the needs of different stakeholders (artists, fans, labels) in feature prioritization.
2. Ensuring the platform is attractive to both web3 enthusiasts and traditional music consumers.
3. Developing a fair and transparent revenue sharing model that satisfies all parties.

The roadmap is designed to be ambitious yet achievable within the 6-month timeframe, with a clear progression from basic functionality to advanced features and significant partnerships.
